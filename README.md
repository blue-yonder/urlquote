Urlquote
========

Fast percent encoding / decoding for python.

**This library is not intended to be a replacement for urllib**. `urllib` is part of the Python standard library and should be your go-to choice to quote and unquote URLs. However, should quoting or unquoting of URLs be known to be a performance bottleneck and you are fine with the encoding described below, then by all means have fun using this library.

Usage
-----

```python
from urlquote import quote

quoted = quote('/El Ni√±o/')
assert(quoted == '/El%20Ni%C3%B1o/'.encode('utf-8'))
```

Compatibility
-------------

Since this library uses a `cffi` interface it should work fine with any version of Python. For Linux the wheel has to be build against a version of libc older or equal to the version of libc on the platform the wheel will be used on.

Installation
------------

```bash
pip install urlquote
```

`quote` operates on UTF-8-encoded bytes. If passed a string, it will encode it into UTF-8 first. It will always return UTF-8-encoded bytes. `unquote` behaves the same way.

Encoding
--------

The following encodings are offered. `DEFAULT_QUOTING` is used in case the quoting parameter is not specified.

| Name                 | Additional encoded characters                                                                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SIMPLE_QUOTING       |                                                                                                                     |
| DEFAULT_QUOTING      | space, `<`,`>`,`` ` ``,`?`,`{`,`}`                                                                                  |
| QUERY_QUOTING        | space, `"`,`#`,`<`,`>`                                                                                              |
| PATH_SEGMENT_QUOTING | space, `"`,`#`,`<`,`>`,`` ` ``,`?`,`%`,`/`                                                                          |
| USERINFO_QUOTING     | space, `"`,`#`,`<`,`>`,`` ` ``,`?`,`{`,`}`,`/`,`:`,`;`,`=`,`@`,`\`,`[`,`]`,`^`,`\|`                                 |
| PYTHON_3_7_QUOTING   | space, `"`,`#`,`<`,`>`,`` ` ``,`?`,`{`,`}`,`$`,`%`,`&`,`\`,`(`,`)`,`,`,`=`,`;`,`:`,`!`,`@`,`[`,`]`,`^`,`\|`,`+`,`*` |

Non printable and non standard ASCII characters are always quoted. The `PYTHON_3_7_QUOTING` is going to work the same way in every Python version the name is only refering to the `urllib` default encoding used in Python 3.7.

Development
-----------

This library is a thin wrapper around the Rust crate [`percent-encoding`](https://crates.io/crates/percent-encoding). It exposes part of its functionality to python via a C interface using [`milksnake`](https://github.com/getsentry/milksnake).

To build it you need to [install Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html). Than you can proceed to build the wheel with:

```bash
python setup.py build sdist bdist_wheel
```

To execute the Python tests use:

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest test.py
```

There are also some Rust-only unit tests. To execute them change into the `rust` subdirectory and call.

```bash
cargo test
```

With the nightly toolchain installed you may also call the Rust-only benchmarks using:

```bash
cargo +nightly bench
```
